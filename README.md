# Genome Sequencing Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of key algorithms used in genome assembly and sequencing analysis. The focus is on graph-based approaches, particularly De Bruijn and Overlap graphs, which reconstruct sequences from k-mer reads, similar to data generated in real-world DNA sequencing experiments.

## üß¨ What is a Motif?

Genome sequencing is the process of determining the complete DNA sequence of an organism‚Äôs genome ‚Äî that is, the exact order of nucleotides (A, C, G, T) in its DNA. Modern sequencing technologies produce large amounts of short DNA fragments, called reads, rather than the entire genome in one piece. These reads typically come as millions of small sequences (k-mers) or paired reads (two k-mers separated by a known gap), which are noisy and unordered. Because sequencing machines produce millions of short, overlapping fragments, computational algorithms are essential to reconstruct the original genome.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use

### 1. Prepare Input

Ensure your DNA sequences are listed line-by-line in a plain text file (e.g., `dna_list_example.txt`). Each line should contain a reference ID (e.g. seq1) followed by a single DNA string. For example:

  seq1
  ACATCGATCATGCTGACTGA

  seq2
  ACAGCTTTTACGGAGCGTTA

### 2. Run the Algorithms

Each script reads from the input file and prints:

- The **consensus motif**
- The **score** (lower score = better consensus)
- The list of **best motifs** found

---

#### Greedy Motif Search

  bash
```python greedy_motif_search_with_pseudocounts.py```

#### Randomized Motif Search

  bash
```python randomized_motif_search.py```

#### Gibbs Sampler Motif Search 

  bash
```python randomized_motif_search_with_gibbs_sampler.py```

You can change the default parameters (k, t, and N) directly in each script's function call at the bottom.

## üß† Algorithm Overviews

### Greedy Motif Search

- Iteratively builds a motif set by choosing the most probable k-mer using a profile.
- Fast and deterministic, but may get stuck in local optima.

### Randomized Motif Search

- Starts with random k-mers, updates motifs using profiles until convergence.
- Repeated multiple times to improve chances of a better result.

### Gibbs Sampling

- Iteratively refines motifs by randomly sampling one at a time based on profiles.
- Often yields better motifs with enough iterations.
